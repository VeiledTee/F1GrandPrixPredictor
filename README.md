# 🏎️ F1 Grand Prix Predictor

Single‑script pipeline that

1. trains several regressors (Gradient Boosting, Lasso, MLP),  
2. benchmarks them on a fixed train/test split, **and**  
3. produces a ranking / winner prediction for the next Grand Prix,

using only pre‑race information (qualifying laps, grid slot, historical
performance, tyre strategy, weather, etc.).

## 2 Key engineered features

Here’s an updated version of your **README.md**, with the engineered features now **fully documented** based on your `feature_engineering.py` logic.

---

### ✅ Changes made to section 2: "Key engineered features"

- Rewrote and expanded the feature list into distinct **categories**.
- Included **practice**, **quali**, **race**, **strategy**, **weather**, and **seasonal trend** features.
- Clarified computed targets like `winner` and `pos_change`.

Here’s the updated section you can paste directly into your README:

## 2 Key engineered features

The `engineered_features.csv` file - generated by `feature_engineering.py` - provides the following information per line per driver per Grand Prix:

### 🏁 Qualifying Features
| Feature             | Description                                                  |

| `lap1_pos_change`    | Position change from grid to Lap 1               |
| `pos_change`         | Position change from grid to race finish         |

### 🔧 Strategy & Tyre Usage
| Feature              | Description                                         |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `num_stops`          | Number of tyre stints (estimated from compound changes) |
| `avg_stint_len`      | Average number of laps per tyre stint              |
| `pct_soft`, `pct_medium`, `pct_hard`, etc. | Fraction of laps per tyre compound      |

### 🌦️ Conditions & Reliability
| Feature              | Description                                       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `pct_caution_laps`   | Share of laps affected by yellow flags/SC/VSC     |
| `pct_rain_laps`      | Share of laps during rainfall                     |

## 3 Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[data_collection.py] --> B(race_data_full.csv)
    B --> C[feature_engineering.py]
    C --> D(engineered_features.csv)
    D --> E(gp_predictor.py ← trains + predicts)
```

### 3.1 Download / refresh raw data
```bash
python data_collection.py           # (2024 – 2025 races by default)
```

### 3.2 Generate features
```bash
python feature_engineering.py
# or inject a minimal quali table for the current GP:
python feature_engineering.py --mini-q qualifying_saudi.csv --year 2025 --round 4
```

### 3.3 Train, benchmark, and predict
```bash
python lap_time_predictor.py  # training + metrics only
python lap_time_predictor.py --quali_csv qualifying_saudi.csv  # training + metrics + prediction
```

`qualifying_saudi.csv` needs only `driver`, `q1` lap time, `q2` lap time, `q3` lap time, and starting grid position (`start_grid`)
```csv
driver,q1,q2,q3,start_grid
Max Verstappen,87.778,87.529,87.294,1
Oscar Piastri,87.901,87.545,87.304,2
...
```
The script auto‑fills **`season_avg_pos_delta`** - how much a driver's final placement changes from grid placement - from the latest engineered CSV.
Unknown drivers default to the training‑set mean (~0).

## 4 Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt:`
```
fastf1>=3.0
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
joblib
matplotlib
```

FastF1 uses the `./cache/` directory configured in `data_collection.py` for on‑disk caching.

Happy predicting!🏁
